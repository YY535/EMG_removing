# EMG_removing
MATLAB toolbox for removing high frequency EMG artifacts from the multichannel extracellular recording with ICA.

This is generally an overcomplete ICA problem since the number of the potential signal sources is much larger than the recording sites. Lower frequency physiological signal is going to affect the separation.

The current version use the spectrum whitening to enphasize the high frequency EMG tone (`EMG_rm_main.m`).
In an early version we use highpassed (>100 Hz) data to find the EMG component. The related functions (`ÃˆMG_rm.m`) are still left there.

## Examples:

```matlab
% running the pipeline
addpath(genpath('/path/to/EMG_removing'))
cd('/path/to/the/head/dictionary/of/your/sessions')
denoise_shank = 1;% or [shank1, shank2....]
EMG_rm_pip([],denoise_shank)
```

or go to your session and try:

```matlab
% running for one session
addpath(genpath('/path/to/EMG_removing'))
cd('/path/to/the/session')
FileBase = session_name;
denoise_shank = 1;
rm_line_noise = true; 
EMG_rm_main(FileBase,[],denoise_shank,[],rm_line_noise)
```

- Notice the function `EMG_rm_main.m` or `EMG_rm_long.m` by defualt automatically remove the line noise component. If you don't want to do this, set this parameter to `false`. 

## Check the Results:
The cleaned signals will be saved in `.lfpd` files and the EMG activity in `.emg`. The EMG signals (`EMG_au`) and the EMG components `AW.As` is saved in `FileBase.EMG_rm.mat`. To check the cleaned signal, use:

```matlab
cd('/path/to/your/sessions')
EMG_rm_view()
PYR_Channel = 37;% choose the channel to visualize the effect. 
EMG_rm_report([],PYR_Channel) % or we'll use the channel with the largest ripple power.
EMG_rm_viewspec()
% play with the nfft and the window length to compute the spectrum when you have a long file. 
EMG_rm_viewnoise()
```
When computing the properties of slower frequency signals, e.g., delta wave phase and power, it is recommended to use the original signal `x_orig`. The original signal could also be reconstructed by the EMG activities. In case of useing channel `ch_delta` (`x` is the cleaned data):

```
ch_delta ;% the selected channel
x_d = x(:,ch_delta);% the cleaned signal
x_r = AW.As(ch_delta)*EMG_au(:);% the EMG signal
x_orig = x_d + x_r;
```
