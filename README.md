# EMG_removing
Removing high frequency EMG artifacts from the multichannel extracellular recording with ICA.

This is generally an overcomplete ICA problem since the number of the potential signal sources is much larger than the recording sites. Lower frequency physiological signal is going to affect the separation.

The current version use the spectrum whitening to enphasize the high frequency EMG tone (`EMG_rm_main.m`).
In an early version we use highpassed (>100 Hz) data to find the EMG component. The related functions (`ÃˆMG_rm.m`) are still left there.

example:

```matlab
% running the pipeline
addpath(genpath('/path/to/EMG_removing'))
cd('/path/to/the/head/dictionary/of/your/sessions')
denoise_shank = 1;
EMG_rm_pip([],denoise_shank)
```

or go to your session and try:

```matlab
% running for one session
addpath(genpath('/path/to/EMG_removing'))
cd('/path/to/the/session')
FileBase = session_name;
denoise_shank = 1;
EMG_rm_main(FileBase,[],denoise_shank)
```

The cleaned signals will be saved in `.lfpd` files. The EMG signals (`EMG_au`) and the EMG components `AW.As` is saved in `FileBase.EMG_rm.mat`. To check the cleaned signal, use:

```matlab
cd('/path/to/your/sessions')
EMG_rm_view()
PYR_Channel = 37;% choose the channel to visualize the effect.
EMG_rm_report([],PYR_Channel)
EMG_rm_viewspec()
EMG_rm_viewnoise()
```
