# EMG_removing
Remove high frequency EMG artifacts from the extracellular recording with ICA.

This is generally an overcomplete ICA problem since the number of the potential signal sources is much larger than the recording sites. Lower frequency physiological signal is going to affect the separation.

The current version use the spectrum whitening to enphasize the high frequency EMG tunes (`EMG_rm_main.m`).
In an early version we use highpassed (>100 Hz) data to find the EMG component. The related functions (`ÃˆMG_rm.m`) are still left there.

example:

```matlab
% running the pipeline
addpath(genpath('/path/to/EMG_removing'))
cd('/path/to/the/head/dictionary/of/your/sessions')
denoise_shank = 1;
EMG_rm_pip([],denoise_shank)
```

The cleaned signals will be saved in `.lfpd` files. The EMG signals (`EMG_au`) and the EMG components `AW.As` is saved in `FileBase.EMG_rm.mat`. To check the cleaned signal, use:

```matlab
cd('/path/to/your/sessions')
EMG_rm_view(FileBase)
```
